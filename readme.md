# Hello!


We are Looking Glass, your friendly holo-hacker crew and makers of the HoloPlayer One. We're guessing you're here to grab the HoloPlay SDK, which you can download over at our forums under releases: http://forum.lookingglassfactory.com/t/holoplay-sdk-download/179

If you're looking for the getting started guide, that can be found here: https://blog.lookingglassfactory.com/getting-started-with-the-holoplay-sdk-dc9aab12b50e

We aim to share the source for the apps we've developed in-house, so most of those can be found here: http://forum.lookingglassfactory.com/c/holoplayer-one-releases

It's preferable to download the source from that releases page rather than what you find here on our GitHub page. That way you can be sure which version of the HoloPlay SDK they are running on and that the source code was from a stable build, which you can also download from the same page.

As always, get in touch with us if you have any questions or suggestions! info@lookingglassfactory.com
